    <h1 id="head"> Hi, Im Tanvi, I like chilling with my friends. Im 11 in the year 2021 and i go to USGS. I love cycling, swimming and digital art. I have a passion for a lot of things.I really like to play games and make videos about them :D My most favorite hobby is cycling. I learnt cyling on 2 wheel cycles at the age of 7. Now me and my best friends cycle together everyday! We have lots of fun! Cycling is especially good at protecting and feeding cartilages as the support given by the bicycle means that the forces that act as a result of body weight are significantly reduced. The circular movement of cycling assists the transport of energy and other metabolic produces to the cartilages, reducing the likelihood of arthrosis.</h1>
